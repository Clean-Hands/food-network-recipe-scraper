# food-network-recipe-scraper
A web scraper that retrieves and downloads all available recipes on foodnetwork.com. Saves all recipies as `.html` files in folders labeled as how the recipes are catagorized at https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/recipes-a-z.

# Usage
Place the `FN Recipe Scraper.py` file in the directory you would like the recipes to be downloaded, and run the script. If the script stops mid-download, no need to fret, just run the file again. It checks if the file it is about to download is already present, and skips it if it exists. This also works if your database is old and you want to download recipes that didn't exist on your initial download.
